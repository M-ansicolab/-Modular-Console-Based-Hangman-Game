#  Hangman Game – C++ Implementation

A simple terminal-based Hangman game implemented in C++, where players try to guess the hidden word to save a character from being hanged. This project demonstrates **modular programming**, **function abstraction**, and **basic control flow** in C++.

---

##  Gameplay Overview

- The player guesses letters of a secret codeword.
- Incorrect guesses reveal parts of the hangman figure.
- The player wins by guessing the word before the full figure is drawn.
